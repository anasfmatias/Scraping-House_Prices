## 1. Introduction

Calculate the gross rental yield of a property

Gross rental yield  = (annual rental income/property value)*100

One popular formula to help you decide if a property is good investment is the 1 percent rule, which advises that the property's monthly rent should be no less than 1 percent of the upfront cost, including any initial renovations and the purchase price


## 2. Data Collection

The data was collected from the Rightmove website for rent and sale properties in London. This website limits the search to 1050 entries per search, so different iterations, subsetting in various features, were created to extract the maximum number of entries possible.  The features used for the subsets were London's region (Central, North, South, North East, South East, North West and South West), number of bedrooms, and values of the properties. In total, 4 datasets were created: 'flats_to_rent', 'houses_to_rent', 'flats_to_buy' and 'houses_to_buy'.
